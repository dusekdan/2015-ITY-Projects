# ITYProjects2015
*University of Technology Brno*

This repository contains all the source texts for projects assigned during academic year 2014/2015 in course of Typography.

You can find loads of stuff covered in LaTeX here. 

If you decide to use this files as inspiration, be aware of the fact that with each year one or more letters in source texts are changed, therefore if you go for straight copy you probably end up infront of disciplinary commision.
